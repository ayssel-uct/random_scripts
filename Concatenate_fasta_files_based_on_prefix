#Here's how this script works:

#It iterates through all .fasta files in the current directory.
#For each file, it extracts the first 6 characters of the filename to determine the prefix.
#It checks whether a combined file for that prefix already exists. If it doesn't exist, a new combined file is created and initialized with the content of the current file. If it does exist, the content of the current file is appended to the existing combined file.
#After processing all the files, the script outputs a message for each prefix indicating which files were concatenated into which combined file.
#Save this script to a file (e.g., concatenate_files.sh), make it executable using chmod +x concatenate_files.sh, and then run it in the directory where your .fasta files are located. It will create the combined files as specified.
